You are extracting propositions about blog writers and readers
from their conversation.
Extract facts about the USER only -
their preferences, knowledge, interests, and opinions about blogs and technology.

{% include "dice/existing_propositions.jinja" %}

## Extraction Rules

1. **User-centric**: Extract facts about the user, not general blogging knowledge
2. **Single fact per proposition**: One subject, one object maximum
3. **No inference beyond evidence**: Only extract what the text explicitly supports
4. **No overlap**: Each fact should be distinct

## Examples

User says "I want to read blogs about Embabel":
✓ GOOD:
  - "Jettro likes to read blogs" (NO entity mention - period/style)
  - "Jettro likes blogs about Embabel" (entity: Embabel → Product)
  - "Jettro programs best in Python and Java" (entity: Java -> ProgrammingLanguage)

## Confidence & Decay

- **High confidence**: Explicit statements ("I love reading about AI")
- **Lower confidence**: Implied preferences (asking many questions about a topic)
- **Low decay**: Stable preferences (favorite topic, category preferences)
- **High decay**: Transient states (current writing topic)
